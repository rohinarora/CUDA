* Slide 7. Reduction tree. Total operations are still N-1. But steps are now log(n) (vs N-1). How so? At cost of hardware
* "work-efficient parallel algorithm"
* One drawback. At 1st level- N/2 threads. At 2nd level. N/4 threads. Number of threads used decreases exponentially.
  * Some workaround will come soon
